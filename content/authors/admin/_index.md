I am a PhD researcher at MACHINA, which is a Delft Artificial Intelligence Lab (DAI-Lab). My research at TU Delft is part of the Marie-Curie project  'LIGHTEN - Ultralight membrane structures towards a sustainable environment'. I will focus on topology optimization of membrane structures. The goal is to complement traditional topology optimization with a data-driven approach as a way to accelerate the search for the optimized structure.
